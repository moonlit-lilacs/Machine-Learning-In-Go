# Machine Learning In Go
A re-implementation of my initial "Machine Learning In C" project, now using Go. Since re-implementing the original, I've switched from the initial Sigmoid function to a Leaky ReLU, added gradient snipping and added normalization values. In the future I'd like to make some adjustments so it can eventually handle the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. It's *possible* it could handle it now, but I haven't attempted it since even training it to add two numbers up to 20 is quite slow and prone to idling at some values for long periods of time.
